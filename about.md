Hi, I am Adrian and a software developer. A few days ago I have decided that the time has come to create my own blog while I was working on the first [cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com) challenge.

Since I am very interested in everything related to Vim, C and Ethical Hacking, I want to educate myself a little in these topics. The main idea is to document stuff I do and use this blog as a reference.
